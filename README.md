##Creation
After seeing a demand for an Ikov dungeoneering script, I decided to create my own. Before mine, there weren't really any quality dungeoneering scripts on the BDN. This is my first combat script that has been released and I'm happy with it so far. There were a lot of bugs during the first few revisions but I was able to squash most of them and give the community a solid script. I decided to make it free because I've always hated it when scripts that don't make large amounts of money were paid. As a long-time member of Parabot, the first scripts that I ever used were made by the likes of Matt and MrsDefNerd and I never had to pay for them.
##Experienced
The API is used to the fullest in Minimal Dungeoneering to bring you the quickest, most reliable performance. In addition to sleep conditions, the strategies are looped through in a waterfall structure where one cannot continue until the other has passed. This was possible thanks to the input of the Parabot community.
